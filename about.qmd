I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) while wrapping up work on my PhD. My work focuses on integrating climate and ecosystem information into fisheries management systems and evaluating management efficacy through simulation testing. 

My interest in this work was sparked while pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Marine Science and Biology from the University of Miami which I completed in 2016. I moved to Massachusetts to attend graduate school at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth's School of Marine Science and Technology (SMAST) where I worked to develop Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management alternatives in New England. As a PhD candidate I am working to complete several Management Strategy Evaluation projects focused on assessing the efficacy of these alternatives and their consequences for fisheries in the Northeast U.S. 

At GMRI I co-organize and lead a monthly open data science meeting and I previously co-founded the South Coast MA UseR group to build a community of open science practitioners at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and partners across southern Massachusetts. During my time at UMass Dartmouth I also served as a graduate student representative for SMAST's graduate student association and represented SMAST on the university's Graduate Student Senate during the 2019-2020 academic year. In this role I managed the senate website and served as chair for the COVID-19 Relief Funding Committee. In my free time I also play saxophone in university and community bands.
